I have been a software developer since 1998.  Fourteen years were spent as an Application Development Manager for a mission-critical application of 50K+ users. I have managed as many as 31 full-time and 16 contract application and database developers simultaneously. I have developed code in many industries and platforms, including the shrink-wrap software industry and scientific applications such as satellite command and control centers. I have also developed code for applications within the financial sector.

Having worked in many industries, I have seen and done many things.  I have successfully deployed 1000+ projects and managed multi-million-dollar personnel and hardware/software budgets.  I know the supply chain and contract processes, working through details of contracts, site surveys, and on-boarding/off-boarding personnel.  I know what it takes to produce secure, quality products in the IT industry.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and an M.S. in Cybersecurity.  I hold various industry certifications and spend considerable time with red and blue team activities and events, bug bounty programs, and reading books and trade journals.

I currently work on a “security-focused” application team, leading and acting as a liaison for DevSecOps.  We have many applications and groups working to adopt the security mindset and need guidance regarding security from the start; security peer reviews, establishing secure designs, SAST, DAST, and CI/CD pipeline.  I provide this guidance and help move our organization forward in its security posture.

I am available to work and actively looking for a new position in Information Security.  Please reach out if you want to talk further.
