Nothing formal or special, just my notes on particular topics. I choose to document the information here for my reference.  There may be typos, inconsistent formatting, and possibly be incorrect.  I know it is helpful to me and possibly useful to others on occasion. I am always open to talk about what is here or even be corrected if something is wrong.
