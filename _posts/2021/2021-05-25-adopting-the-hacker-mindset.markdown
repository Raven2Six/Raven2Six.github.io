Adopting the Hacker Mindset

Recently I have been studying for the Pentest+ exam, and one item I have come across in multiple sources is the notion of “adopting the hacker mindset.”    

This concept represents a state of vigilance and awareness of your environment.  View your surroundings for defenses, understand the gaps and weaknesses, and devise a plan to circumvent the protection.  This mindset will help you approach situations as a pentester and will help you as a defender. Viewing your defenses and devising methods to attack them will ensure you develop and implement the best controls for your environment.

The Pentest+ Study Guide (Chapple & Seidl, 2019) contains lab exercises and poses a question: think about the grocery store where you usually shop and some of the security measures used by that store to prevent the theft of cash and merchandise?  What ways can you think of defeating these controls?

I have given these questions some thought, which are much more complicated than I initially imagined.  My grocery store has (1) security cameras in high-risk areas, (2) primarily vigilant employees, and (3) locked and software-controlled cash drawers. 

Are the cameras wireless or wired?  How would I find that out?  Can I impact the operation of the security cameras?  What is the coverage area for the cameras?  
Are the employees less vigilant at or near shift change?  What about the time of day, does that impact their observation?  

Is the cash register software vulnerable?  What if it was? How would that impact a security assessment?

My assessment is still underway, and I will keep you posted on my thoughts and answers to the above.

These are all difficult questions, and it is a difficult task to adopt this mindset.  If you are engaged in conducting a security assessment of your local store, these are the type of things you will need to be prepared to answer.

Do you have a hacker mindset?  How would you answer the questions for your local grocery store?  Think about it.
