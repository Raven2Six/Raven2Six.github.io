Online cybersecurity training platforms
We are fortunate to have many online opportunities for education and training.  Some of my favorites are Hack the Box (https://www.hackthebox.eu) and TryHackMe (https://tryhackme.com).  
I find TryHackMe (THM) to be more educational and more straightforward for learning.  It is an easy platform to jump in and start.  There are learning paths that award certificates upon completion, and the daily-streak feature is quite addicting!
Hack The Box (HTB) is undoubtedly educational, but you operate without training wheels.  It takes a bit longer to get acclimated to the environment, but it is impressive and makes you want to push your skill set and stretch your wings.  
I wish I had much more time to dedicate to these sites at this point in my life and professional career.  The vast number of areas such as HTB and THM is impressive.  We have much at our fingertips, take control of your education and take advantage of everything at your disposal.  Happy hacking!
