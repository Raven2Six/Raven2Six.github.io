The importance of persistence.  

Achieving mastery in any area of cybersecurity is a challenging and worthy pursuit.  The breadth and depth are incredible.  How do you determine where to focus your time?  Are you more interested in red teaming?  Blue-teaming?  How about Purple-teaming?  Those are all tough choices and only represent a small portion of available options.  Most of us want to say, “I want to know all that.”  It isn’t quite that simple, at least not for me.

I want to know everything, but there is only so much time in a day.  I spend many daily hours studying, researching, and performing practical exercises.  I am nowhere near where I want to be.  However, I must remind myself daily that I am doing what I need to do.  Persistence pays off.  Set goals, keep a checklist of items, and do whatever you need to stay focused.

This entire entry is much like the others, just my somewhat random thoughts.  However, we all need to hear occasionally – or read – that we are doing what we need to do.  It is hard; we are overwhelmed with information but keep at it.  Keep studying, keep learning.  They say, “A black belt is a white belt who never gave up.”
