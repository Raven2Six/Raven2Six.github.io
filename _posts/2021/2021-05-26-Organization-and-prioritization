Organization and Prioritization

So how do you keep organized with your work tasks?  I was recently asked this in an interview, and it started me thinking about what others must do to keep up on their tasks.

For me, there are a few specific things.  The first and most consistent thing is keeping an actual task list or checklist of the work I need to complete, both professionally and personally.  I generally keep a daily and comprehensive list of more significant, lengthier items.  Second, I am constantly updating based on priorities.  

Senior management and business partners often have requests of great importance or tasks they need my assistance to complete.  I generally prioritize tasks for others ahead of my own.  Yes, there are occasions that this is problematic, but it is very infrequent.  For the agile folks, think of it as a backlog and reprioritize the stories based on feedback.

I have tried various organization methods and tracking of my tasks, but it seems that all the other techniques fall away, and I return to the tried-and-true checklists.  Ultimately, I believe the best method of organization and prioritization is the one you will use.
