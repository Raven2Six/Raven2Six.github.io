Decisions

Many of the industry certifications can be expensive.  If you don’t already do so, enter CTF events and keep an eye out for non-school-related scholarships.  The events themselves are great education opportunities, and doing well can occasionally lead to additional possibilities to further your knowledge. 

I was awarded a scholarship for CISSP classroom instruction, materials, and exam fees.  Sadly, due to Covid, there aren’t any classroom sessions scheduled.  Not just this year, none at all.  Hopefully, more are put on the schedule as the year goes on.  

As with most things, I struggle with patience on stuff like this and unsure if I can wait for classes to come around.  So I am conflicted over my options and what avenue to pursue.  I am confident in my existing knowledge and ability to self-study before the exam, but I am shortchanging myself if I don’t attend classroom training.  

Things could always be worse.  I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity I have received, regardless of the training method. 

Keep an eye out for opportunities.  There are many out there!
