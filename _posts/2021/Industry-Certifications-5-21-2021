Industry certifications
There weren't many industry certifications when I started in the Information Technology field.  Today, they are pretty standard and, in many ways, expected.

As a hiring manager, I thought certifications were excellent and demonstrated extra effort on the part of the candidate.  They proved that an individual could learn, be motivated for additional information, and show initiative, especially since many certifications required them to pay for themselves.  

The desire to pursue industry certifications is strong in me.  Part of the desire is my thirst for knowledge and unending curiosity.  While the rest is validation that, yes, I do know something.  

Many in the industry will argue about the validity of certifications and what certification is the best and worst.  Twitter is full of everyone’s opinions on the matter.  I believe people should pursue education opportunities regardless of what Twitter experts say.  Everyone has an opinion on everything.

Today I ran across an article published by BishopFox.  It is a great article that nails the issue, and I hope you will read it.  https://labs.bishopfox.com/industry-blog/security-certs-choose-your-own-adventure?utm_campaign=2021_Posts_Blog_Industry&utm_content=167550124&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-232312
