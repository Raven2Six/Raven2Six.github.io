Gatekeepers

I had a job interview today.  Nothing major, and if it worked out, it would have been a side gig.  I applied for a position that happened to get filled earlier in the morning.  Rather than sending me a cancellation, the employer kept the meeting.  During the discussion, they discussed another software development position and asked me a few questions.

They asked if I had Java experience.  I stated that I do have Java experience.  They then asked if I had experience writing code for mobile platforms such as Android.  I said no, I hadn’t written code for Android, but I have had to hack into some.  Of course, they weren’t looking for that kind of experience and needed someone with mobile development experience.  We ended the conversation about 10 minutes later.

All of that brings me to my issue, HR and “talent acquisition” people that don’t have a clue about technology.  In this example, it is related to programming languages; however, we see this as an issue all the time with cybersecurity roles and HR “gatekeepers.”  

Individuals act in these roles as gatekeepers and are not helping their organizations.  Someone must screen out unqualified candidates, starting with realistic job qualifications and knowledgeable screeners.  Job postings requiring a CISSP or CISM certification for a middle or entry-level position are ridiculous.  Sadly, I see job postings like this every single day.

Additionally, individuals screening candidates need domain knowledge to understand which skills are transferrable.  In my example of programming languages, I have many years of programming in many languages.  I believe most people can pick up any other language after becoming proficient in one.  Once you understand what the language is doing, other languages become simple and easy to adopt.  This example of transferrable knowledge is typical in many aspects of the IT industry.  I understand if an employer had to have a candidate with niche skills, but those cases should be the exception, not the norm.

Why do we continue to see these issues in the Information Technology industry?  I believe the industry is moving quickly, and some aspects, such as job screening, haven’t caught up. Usually, I think this is okay, and everything will level out, but the HR screeners and many employers do not recognize this issue and are genuinely ignorant of the problem.
