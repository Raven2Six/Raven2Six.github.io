Today, I received a surprise in the mail, a very cool coin and stickers from the NCL.  These awards were for finishing in the top 500 players in their spring 2021 competition.  Four thousand one hundred eighty individual players competed over a few days in ten unique skill areas from OSINT to Exploitation. 
NCL describes the competition as “students work to solve challenges such as identifying hackers from forensic data, pentesting and auditing vulnerable websites, recovering from ransomware attacks, and more.”
A pre-season event precedes the individual competition.  The results of the pre-season determine bracket placement for the individual competition.  I placed 375th out of 5794 competitors in the gold bracket for individual competition.
My final placing in the gold bracket was 348 out of 628 players, and I placed 426 out of 4180 overall.  
I truly enjoyed the NCL event and highly recommend it to anyone eligible.  The environment and the problems are top-notch and will require you to push the boundaries of your knowledge.  It is a great organization, and you should check them out, https://nationalcyberleague.org/
